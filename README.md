# Lightm

Lightm is a [RMRK EVM](https://github.com/rmrk-team/evm) fork, and it uses the [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)'s [diamond 2](https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-2-hardhat) implementation to implement [RMRK Spec](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-spec/tree/master/standards/abstract).

## Note
To be added.

## Local Development
- Run `npm i` or `yarn` to install deps first.
- Run `npx hardhat node` to start a local hardhat node.
- Follow [Deployment](#deployment)

## Deployment

We use `Create2Deployer` to make sure the "to be deployed" contract addresses is predictable and so we could replay a tx on different chains and get same addresses on them. If you have some custom logics, it's totally **optional**.

Use `npx hardhat run --network localhost ./scripts/[script-name].ts` to run scripts below. If you don't specify network, it will run on Ethereum. For more infos please go to [hardhat site](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started).

### Full-automatic on-chain deployment

The `Full-automatic on-chain deployment` is a more appropriate approach for creators whom cannot write code. Contracts containing the same implementation code on different chains should be deployed only once. 

**Before you invoke the script below in a non-local development environment, make sure that no contract has been deployed on this chain(Check if `Create2Deployer` is deployed on target chain, its address is `0xcf2281070e6a50e4050694eef1a9a7376628d663`), otherwise this is a redundant action (except you wanna deploy your own custom factory)**.

Go to [./scripts/deploy](./scripts/deploy_universal_factory.ts) to deploy universal factory and make NFT deployment happening tolly on chain.

### Semi-automatic deployment

Go to [./scripts/deploy_diamond_equippable.ts](./scripts/deploy_diamond_equippable.ts) to deploy your own custom NFT.
