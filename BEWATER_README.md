# Bewater Readme

This is the DEMO branch for attending [bewater](https://build.bewater.xyz)

FE: https://github.com/LightmNFT/lightm-bewater-demo
Indexer: https://github.com/LightmNFT/lightm-squid/tree/sepolia

## How to start?

Check [Deployment](./README.md/#deployment). And I've prepared an all-in-one script.

1. `npx hardhat node`
2. `npx hardhat run --network localhost ./scripts/deploy_universal_factory.ts`
3. `npx hardhat run --network localhost ./scripts/deploy_demo_all_in_one.ts`

You also need to [get some test ETH on Sepolia](https://www.google.com/search?q=sepolia+faucet).
